# Processing of digital images
 * A collection of really awful code that was made during processing of digital images labs. Some of these ones do not even work due to lacking backwards compatibility. 
 * There is also project describing differences between *k-means* algorithm with random initialization and *k-means++* that was commited in Python. Not great, not terrible imho.
